# Feature Specification: Spec-Kit Latest News to HTML

**Feature Branch**: `001-spec-kit-html`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ÊêúÁ¥¢spec-kitÁöÑÊúÄÊñ∞Ê∂àÊÅØÔºåÁîüÊàêhtmlÔºå‰∏≠Êñá"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to get the latest news about spec-kit, which should be presented as a single HTML file in Chinese.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I provide the topic 'spec-kit', **When** the system searches for the latest news, **Then** it generates an HTML file containing the news in Chinese.
2. **Given** the system cannot find any news for 'spec-kit', **When** it tries to generate the file, **Then** the output HTML file should clearly state that no news was found.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the news source is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does the system handle non-text content (e.g., images, videos) found in the source news articles?
- What is the definition of "latest" news? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the time window for the search, e.g., past 24 hours, past week?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST search the web for recent news articles related to 'spec-kit'.
- **FR-002**: System MUST process the content of the found articles.
- **FR-003**: System MUST consolidate the relevant news into a single HTML document.
- **FR-004**: The content of the HTML document MUST be in Chinese.
- **FR-005**: The output MUST be a valid HTML file.
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle cases where no news is found and report this in the output HTML file.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST search for news within a defined time window. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the time window for "latest" news?]
